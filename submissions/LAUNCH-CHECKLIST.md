## Handling Criticism

**Common critiques and responses:**

| Critique | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "It's just threat modeling" | Yes, applied to AI agents with structural enforcement |
| "Same model shares blind spots" | Agreed, Condition D not yet tested. Structure still helps. |
| "Overhead is too high" | Depends on domain. Skip for prototypes. |
| "Not peer reviewed" | Methodology is public and reproducible. Working on paper. |
| "Simulation, not real agents" | Fair. Production study is on roadmap. |
